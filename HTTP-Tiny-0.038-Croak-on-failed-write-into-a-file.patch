Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Croak on failed write into a file
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The mirror() method saves a document into a file. Any error while
writing to the file, e.g. no disk space, was ignored. This patch fixes
it by croaking on such I/O error.
